# Openmind

~~[Try out the demo!](https://openmind.macroexpanse.com)~~
Sadly, this project is on hiatus and the live demo has been mothballed.

Feedback is welcome. Please feel free to create an issue.

This is still an early iteration. Take a look at the [abstract](OpenMindIntro.pdf) for the
bigger idea.

## Development Mode

Steps:

1. Copy `example.conf.edn` to `conf.edn` in the root dir. Edit the config
   variables to point to your Elasticsearch cluster, your S3 bucket (the default
   one is publicly readable, so feel free to leave it if you're just working on
   the front end), and your AWS credentials if you're using your own S3 bucket.
2. Start Elasticsearch. The script `dev/setup.sh` will start an Elasticsearch
   instance in a docker container and populate it from S3 if `s3-data-bucket` is
   configured in `conf.edn`.
3. Start the clj/cljs repls in your favourite editor. In emacs that's just a
   matter of `cider-jack-in-clj&cljs`.
4. In the clj repl, load the `openmind.server` namespace and run `(init!)` to
   start the server.
6. Navigate to http://localhost:3003 in your browser (if you didn't change the
   `:port` config in `conf.edn`.
7. Have at it.
